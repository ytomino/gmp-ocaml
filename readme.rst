GMP, MPFR and MPC interface library for Objective-Caml
======================================================

What's this?
------------

Objective-Caml binding to the multiple precision arithmetic libraries GMP, MPFR
and MPC.

Prerequisites
-------------

OCaml >= 4.08
 https://ocaml.org/
GMP >= 4.3
 http://gmplib.org/
MPFR >= 2.4
 http://www.mpfr.org/
MPC >= 0.9
 http://www.multiprecision.org/

How to make
-----------

Install
+++++++

::

 make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Specify your preferred directory to ``PREFIX``.
The libraries would be installed into ``$PREFIX/lib/ocaml`` (default is
``ocamlc -where``).

If GMP is not installed in the default search path, specify the directory
containing GMP to ``WITH_GMP``.
``$WITH_GMP/include`` and ``$WITH_GMP/lib`` would be used.
``WITH_MPFR`` and ``WITH_MPC`` are similar.

Uninstall
+++++++++

::

 make uninstall PREFIX=/usr/local

Build examples
++++++++++++++

::

 make -C examples
